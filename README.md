_SPITZ Perceives Informatively The Zone_
- - -

SPITZ is a project born from a personal experience and the collaboration of three students — Gabriel Moya, Daniela Azouri and Enrique Martínez. 
On December of 2023, I had an accident where a car ran hit me. Then I started thinking...

Cars have cameras and mirrors, motorbikes as well, but, what about micromobility vehicles? What about scooters, skateboards, longboards, monowheels, and other such vehicles?
With the growing micromobility trend, it's essential to be cautious. SPITZ, a smart little arduino project consisting of just a servo, an HC-SR04 sensor and an Arduino board helps with just that.

Free Software, Free society.
